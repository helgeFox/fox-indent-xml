##SublimeText plugin: Cleaning tool for XML's in FOX Publish
-----------------------------------------

### Installation

####Sublime Text Package Control

You need to have a package called Package Control installed. This is a plugin for Sublime Text that manages other packages for you. From Package Control you can manage (install/uninstall/update and much more) all your sublime plugins. Here's how to get started:
* Open Sublime Text (2 or 3).
* Go to `View->Show Console`
* Visit [packagecontrol.io](https://packagecontrol.io/installation) and copy the text from the corresponding tab (sublime text 2 or 3).
* Copy selected text and paste into Sublime Text console (the field at bottom of Sublime Text Window that appeared during step two).
* Hit `Enter`, wait a couple of seconds and you should see a message saying Package Control has been installed.
* (Optionally) go to `View->Hide Console` to free up screen real estate (or just hit `esc`).

####Fox-Cleaning-Tool

You need to have the [repository for FOX Publish][] added to package control then just install `FOX-indentXml` as any other package.

####Configuring

You can configure the plugin like any other plugin in Sublime Text like keyboard shortcuts etc. Check out the (unofficial) [documentation](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/intro.html).
